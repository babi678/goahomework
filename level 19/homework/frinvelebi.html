    <h2 id="bird1"><i>Eagle</i></h2>
    <img src="bird1.jpg" alt="Here was a photo" title="Eagle" width="500" height="350">
    <p>Eagles are large, powerful birds of prey belonging to the family Accipitridae, known for their keen eyesight, <br>
    strong talons, and soaring flight. With over 60 species spread across the globe, eagles are most commonly <br>
    found in Eurasia and Africa, with a few species in North and South America, as well as Australia. <br>
    These majestic birds are apex predators, feeding mainly on fish, small mammals, and other birds, depending on their habitat. <br>
    Their vision is among the sharpest in the animal kingdom, allowing them to spot prey from several kilometers away. <br>
    Eagles build large nests, often reused for many years, typically high up in trees or on cliffs. <br>
    Among the most well-known species are the Bald Eagle, which is the national symbol of the United States, and the Golden Eagle, <br>
    admired for its hunting prowess and speed. Across many cultures, eagles symbolize strength, courage, and freedom, making them powerful icons in mythology, <br>
    religion, and national emblems around the world.</p>

    <h2 id="bird2"><i>Raven</i></h2>
    <img src="bird2.jpg" alt="Here was a photo" title="Raven" width="500" height="350">
    <p>Ravens are large, intelligent birds belonging to the genus Corvus, with the most well-known species being the common raven (Corvus corax), <br>
    found across the Northern Hemisphere. Recognized by their glossy black feathers, thick beaks, and deep, croaking calls, <br>
    ravens are among the smartest birds in the world. They exhibit problem-solving skills, the ability to mimic sounds (including human speech), <br>
    and even demonstrate playful behaviors, such as sliding down snow-covered roofs or playing games with other animals. Ravens are omnivores, <br>
    feeding on a wide variety of foods including carrion, insects, grains, fruits, and small animals. Their adaptability <br>
    allows them to live in diverse environments, from mountains and forests to deserts and urban areas. In mythology and folklore, <br>
    ravens often appear as mysterious or magical creatures, symbolizing wisdom, transformation, or death—featured prominently in Norse mythology <br>
    (as Odin's ravens Huginn and Muninn) and literature, such as Edgar Allan Poe's famous poem “The Raven.” Their intelligence, versatility, <br>
    and eerie charm make ravens one of the most fascinating birds in the animal kingdom.</p>

    <h2 id="bird3"><i>Crow</i></h2>
    <img src="bird3.jpg" alt="Here was photo" title="Crow" width="500" height="350">
    <p>Crows are highly intelligent, adaptable birds belonging to the genus Corvus, which also includes ravens, rooks, and jackdaws. <br>
    Found almost everywhere in the world, crows are especially common in urban and rural environments, where their resourcefulness allows them to thrive. <br>
    Typically medium-sized with glossy black feathers, strong beaks, and loud, cawing calls, crows are omnivorous and opportunistic feeders—they eat everything <br>
    from fruits, seeds, and insects to small animals and human leftovers. What makes crows particularly remarkable is their intelligence: they can recognize human faces, <br>
    use tools, solve complex problems, and even pass knowledge across generations. Studies have shown that crows are capable of planning, cooperation, <br>
    and basic understanding of cause and effect—traits once believed to be unique to humans and primates. In many cultures, crows are symbols of mystery, <br>
    magic, or transformation, often associated with both good and bad omens. Their social behavior, communication skills, <br>
    and cleverness make crows one of the most fascinating and misunderstood birds in the animal world.</p>

    <h2 id="bird4"><i>Common cuckoo</i></h2>
    <img src="bird4.jpeg" alt="Here was photo" title="Common cuckoo"  width="500" height="350">
    <p>The Common Cuckoo (Cuculus canorus) is a migratory bird found across Europe and Asia, well known for its distinctive two-note call and its <br>
    unusual breeding behavior. Unlike most birds, the common cuckoo practices brood parasitism—a strategy in which the female lays her eggs in the <br>
    nests of other bird species, leaving the host parents to raise her young. The cuckoo chick usually hatches before the host's own chicks and <br>
    instinctively pushes the other eggs or chicks out of the nest to receive full attention and food from the unsuspecting foster parents. This behavior, <br>
    while harsh, is an evolutionary adaptation that allows the cuckoo to avoid the energy cost of raising offspring. The adult cuckoo has a sleek body, <br>
    grey plumage, and long tail, often resembling a hawk in flight, which may help it avoid predators or scare host birds. Common cuckoos migrate long distances <br>
    between Europe and sub-Saharan Africa each year. In folklore and literature, the cuckoo is often associated with deception and change, but it's also a harbinger <br>
    of spring in many cultures due to its call, which often signals the season's arrival. Despite their secretive nature, cuckoos are a fascinating example <br>
    of evolutionary strategy and survival.</p>

    <h2 id="bird5"><i>Nightingales</i></h2>
    <img src="bird5.jpg" alt="Here was photo" title="Common cuckoo" width="500" height="350">
    <p>The nightingale is a small, unassuming songbird best known for its incredibly beautiful and powerful song, which has inspired poets, musicians, <br>
    and storytellers for centuries. Belonging to the thrush family (Luscinia megarhynchos), the nightingale is found in Europe, parts of Asia, and <br>
    North Africa, often inhabiting woodlands, thickets, and gardens. Despite its plain brown appearance, the nightingale stands out for its rich, <br>
    melodic singing—especially the males, who sing day and night during the breeding season to attract mates and defend their territory. Remarkably, <br>
    nightingales are among the few birds that sing at night, which is how they earned their name. They are migratory, spending their winters in sub-Saharan <br>
    Africa and returning to Europe in the spring. Nightingales feed on insects, larvae, and berries, and are shy by nature, often heard but rarely seen. <br>
    In literature and folklore, the nightingale symbolizes love, longing, and poetic inspiration, famously featured in the works of Shakespeare, Keats, <br>
    and many others. Though their populations are declining in some areas due to habitat loss, nightingales remain a cherished symbol of nature's purest music.</p>
